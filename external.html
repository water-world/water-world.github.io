					<h2>About</h2>
				
					<p>
						Watercolor painting is very very old. It actually dates back to the early stages of the stone age in Europe which is about 2.5 million years ago! It has been used constantly throughout history to now through using the art in Ancient Egypt and middle ages Europe as well as a art style used throughout the Renaissance. At this time, the medium was used commonly for illustrations of plants and wildlife, since it could produce a “real-life” effect. However, the most common use for watercolor was for preparatory sketches and map-making. The English Watercolor Movement had a major influence on the popularity and use of watercolor paintings in the 18th century. Paul Sandby (1730–1809), an English painter who had a previous career in map-making, took his map-making technique and applied it to landscape paintings. J.M.W. Turner (1775–1851), a leader of the English Watercolor Movement, was a Romantic landscape artist who experimented with synthetic mineral pigments in creating expressive nature and technical paintings. Turner, who was inspired by Romantic, large scale landscapist Thomas Girtin, developed unique lighting and brushwork techniques that were different, freer, and regarded as highly influential in the 19th and 20th centuries, as watercolor finally became regarded as an expressive and artistic medium. Now, artists (including you!) have taken advantage of this unique medium to create striking works of art. Watercolor painting is versatile, and can offer rich, vivid tones, or contrasting soft and soothing forms. We appreciate its unique contribution to the art world!
